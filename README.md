## ⭐️ What is this project?

**AI Companion – Human-Like Virtual Interactive Friend** is a unique **voice-interactive AI companion** that features a lively avatar and supports **real-time voice conversations**.

You can treat it as your personal AI companion — whether you want a `virtual girlfriend`, `boyfriend`, `cute pet`, or any other character, it can meet your expectations. The project fully supports `Windows`, `macOS`, and `Linux`, and offers a web-based usage mode.

Thanks to the persistent storage of chat logs, you can always continue your previous unfinished conversations without losing any precious interactive moments.
